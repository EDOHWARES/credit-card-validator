# Credit Card Validator
This Python program validates whether a credit card number inputted by a user is valid or not. It employs the Luhn algorithm (also known as the Luhn formula or modulus 10 algorithm) to determine the validity of the credit card number.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash

git clone https://github.com/EDOHWARES/credit-card-validator.git

## Usage
To use the credit card validator, run the credit_card_validator.py script and follow the instructions:

bash

python credit_card_validator.py -
The program will prompt you to enter a credit card number. Once you input the number, the program will validate it and display whether the credit card number is valid or not.

## Algorithm Used
The program employs the Luhn algorithm, also known as the Luhn formula or modulus 10 algorithm. This algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, including credit card numbers.
